          <p>
            We're excited to announce <strong>Mistral Desktop</strong>, a cross-platform desktop
            application for interacting with Mistral AI's language models. Built with our core
            philosophy of mindful IT — it's designed to be useful, fast, and respectful of your
            privacy and security.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Another AI Client?</h2>
          <p>
            Most AI chat interfaces are web-based, which means your conversations pass through
            third-party servers, your data lives in someone else's cloud, and you're at the
            mercy of service availability. We wanted something different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mistral Desktop runs locally on your machine. Your API key stays on your device.
            Your conversation history is stored locally. When you're done, you close the app
            and everything stays where it belongs — with you.
          </p>

          <h2>Built-in Tools, Built Mindfully</h2>
          <p>
            What makes Mistral Desktop particularly useful is its set of built-in tools that
            extend what you can do with AI assistance:
          </p>
          <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>File Reader</strong> — Load documents, code files, and text directly into your conversation context</li>
            <li><strong>Code Executor</strong> — Run Python snippets in a sandboxed environment to verify calculations or test ideas</li>
            <li><strong>Web Fetcher</strong> — Pull content from URLs to discuss, summarize, or analyze</li>
            <li><strong>Image Viewer</strong> — Share images with vision-capable models for analysis and description</li>
            <li><strong>Export</strong> — Save conversations as Markdown or JSON for documentation and sharing</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              <strong>Privacy note:</strong> All tools run locally. The File Reader doesn't upload
              your files anywhere — it reads them on your machine and includes the content in your
              API request. The Code Executor uses a sandboxed Python environment with no network
              access. Your data stays yours.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Cross-Platform by Design</h2>
          <p>
            Mistral Desktop runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. We've built it with Tauri,
            which means you get a native application experience with a small footprint — no
            Electron bloat, no running a full Chromium instance in the background.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application is lightweight, starts quickly, and stays out of your way when
            you're not using it. System tray integration lets you bring it up instantly
            when you need it.
          </p>

          <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            We've thought carefully about security at every level:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>API Key Storage</strong> — Your Mistral API key is stored in your operating system's secure credential storage (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, Secret Service on Linux)</li>
            <li><strong>No Telemetry</strong> — We don't collect usage data, analytics, or crash reports. The app doesn't phone home.</li>
            <li><strong>Local History</strong> — Conversation history is stored in a local SQLite database. You can export it, delete it, or move it wherever you want.</li>
            <li><strong>Sandboxed Execution</strong> — The code execution feature runs in a restricted environment with no filesystem access outside designated directories and no network access.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source</strong> — The code is available for review. You can build it yourself if you prefer.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>
            Mistral Desktop requires a Mistral AI API key. If you don't have one, you can
            get one from <a href="https://console.mistral.ai/">console.mistral.ai</a>. Mistral
            offers a generous free tier that's suitable for personal use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Download the latest release for your platform from our GitHub releases page.
            Installation is straightforward — on macOS, drag to Applications; on Windows,
            run the installer; on Linux, use the AppImage or install the .deb/.rpm package.
          </p>

          <h2>What's Next</h2>
          <p>
            We're actively developing Mistral Desktop and have several features in the pipeline:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conversation templates and saved prompts</li>
            <li>Multiple model support (switching between Mistral models)</li>
            <li>Custom tool plugins</li>
            <li>Keyboard-driven interface for power users</li>
            <li>Local model support (for running open-weight models on your hardware)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Mindful Software</h2>
          <p>
            Mistral Desktop exemplifies what we mean by "mindful IT" at Data At Work. It's
            mindful of cost — using your own API key means you pay only for what you use,
            with no subscription overhead. It's mindful of performance — native code, small
            footprint, fast startup. It's mindful of security — local processing, secure
            credential storage, no data collection. And it's mindful of sovereignty — your
            data stays on your machine, under your control.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built this tool because we needed it ourselves. We hope you find it useful too.
          </p>
