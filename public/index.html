Cloudflare<br/>
London<br/>
<br/>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>I am hereby applying for the position of Engineering Director, Adoption at Cloudflare. I believe
I would be a strong fit for this position, given my background as both developer and manager,
particularly in SaaS businesses. When working for Zendesk I even had the pleasure of being a
Cloudflare customer – I was leading the Operations team managing the Zendesk Help Center
division, basically a Content Management System in the Zendesk application suite—a service
that integrated extremely well with the core Cloudflare content delivery network, sporting custom
certificates at scale and much, much more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not live within 50 miles of any of your hubs, but London is just a short
hop by plane away from Copenhagen, where I live – so please hear me out – after all, the job
description does mention that Cloudflare does not believe we all fit into neat boxes; perhaps this
is where I stick out a bit.</p>
<p>There’s a good chance I can make it to the office faster than by the M25.</p>
<p>I have managed in, and worked in, SaaS companies with global presence, I have done so in
both development and operations; and actually at all levels of operations, including vendor
management and maintenance of co-location setups – I even installed machinery personally;
leading by example. I have plenty of experience working with online vendor dashboards, with a
focus on monitoring and alerting; I know a good and functional UI when I see it, such as yours;
but I do have experience across many different solutions: Datadog, AWS, Solarwinds, Splunk and
much more. I would be eager to use my experience and expertise to lead the Cloudflare product
experience into the future. I’ve seen and tried countless development models and frameworks,
and it’s clear that Cloudflare excels on technical quality and user experience. AWS is a mess in
comparison.</p>
<p>I see Cloudflare leading by providing clear working solutions to customers.</p>
<p>Obviously, a functional and concise tech stack can be made to ensure this lead position; I know
that, because I’ve been spearheading such implementations before. The aim is not to select
’framework-of-the-week’ but to make solid fact-based decisions, together.</p>
<p>I my capacity as Chief of Staff to the CTO, I have been attending enterprise sales and technical
support, I know what their focus is—and can act on this; I managed and mentored directors
in Support, Operations and Professional Services in dealing with complex technical matters
for enterprise customers and partners. My technical staff delivered dashboards, monitoring,
integration aid and solutions with immediate and measurable effect on sales. Also, I am an eager
hobbyist, using hobby projects for education, to stay up to date. It is remarkable how well hobby
projects can scale to enterprise needs if done right. Please see my project links later in this cover
letter. I’ve been running Linux since 1996, and I’ve never looked back. It just works. I might
consider FreeBSD for the kqueue implementation though.</p>
<p>Cloudflare, being a product lead company with a freemium model, is positioning the product
as the major upsell contributor; and I see that it is working extremely well. I have an account
personally, and I will not hesitate to buy services when I need - my confidence in the solution is
high. As the product suite grows it is crucial for Cloudflare to keep the user interface performant
and precise—thus instilling confidence. Regardless of the state of the internet and the customer
infrastructure, Cloudflare is there, solid and ready to help; this is the vision that I would bring.</p>
<p>I see Cloudflare positioning itself uniquely in the market as being both product driven yet tech-
nically innovative and responsible. The services that Cloudflare delivers, such as web-workers,
need to be considered carefully from a technical perspective in order to work reliably at the
scale of your operations. Therefore it’s a pleasure to see, in your documentation and tooling,
that all Cloudflare offers come with clearly documented product limits, ensuring that customers
know exactly what to expect. Not having product limits regularly tears down SaaS services;
real technicians know that limits are needed to ensure reliability since resources will always be
limited—this is a very valuable, mutual realization in a customer-vendor relationship.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do to manage support and outbound sales cost is to have the product
follow the customer journey and present options intuitively as the business case grows. Nothing
beats that; I have personally lead product features from inception to launch, ensuring that the
technical aim is not lost in translation and meeting transcripts; as is, unfortunately, a risk in large
IT organisations. Undoubtedly my technical background and communicative skills are helping
me out here.</p>
<p>If my resume does not clearly document that I fullfill the needed key competencies, then allow
me to add some more detail here: even from an early point in my career have I been able to
transform team dynamics to the better, there has often been dire siturations in operations when
dealing with SaaS infrastructure and its growing pain—I’ve lead my teams and other teams
through distress and problems, growing together and delivering high pace deployment rates as
well as reducing downtime; specifically for Zendesk, even with an aging application, I managed to
improve uptime from 99.9% to 99.95% at no extra cost, through operational excellence and plain
simple reconfiguration to be compliant with internet standards. In fact my operations teams had
time to spare and was implementing product features when needed</p>
<p>I would be happy to provide references that will testify to my immersive organisational skills;
founded on technical excellence, curiosity and customer focus. I utterly enjoy transforming team
dynamics, aligning stakeholders–and delivering products that live up to market demands. This
enabled me to lead a new data center to completion in just 3 weeks, when experience said 6
months.</p>
<p>Obviously I would need to prove this level of technicality; while my direct contributions to open
source are not numerous, they’re delicate; I strive to improve what is already there, rather
than delivering yet another half-hearted implementation. See for example this update to an
implementation of the trie data structure in Rust: <a href="https://github.com/michaelsproul/rust_radix_trie">github.com/michaelsproul/rust_radix_trie</a>. I
needed it for a project dealing with collation in Unicode, doing locale-based string sorting.</p>
<p>In fact I have been following the Rust language for many years and it is now my go-to language
(even though go-to is considered harmful). I could mention my Rust based basic webapp example:
<a href="https://github.com/jakobdalsgaard/basic-webapp">github.com/jakobdalsgaard/basic-webapp</a>.</p>
<p>As well as the WiFi bridge I did for a Wallas diesel boat heater; the software runs on an ESP32 em-
bedded device, which shows the versatility of the Rust language: <a href="https://gitea.dalsgaard.net/dalsgaard/wallas-esp32c3">gitea.dalsgaard.net/dalsgaard/wallas-esp32c3</a>.
Reverse engineering the serial interface to the heater was a real challenge.</p>
<p>Being an avid beekeeper, I even managed to use this hobby for tech purposes: <a href="https://blog.dalsgaard.net/honey-we-need-a-website.html">blog.dalsgaard.net/honey-we-need-a-website.html</a>. This is a walk-through of configuring Nginx for maximum security score;
I see network and security as some of my core technical focus points. Wireshark is one of my pre-
ferred tools and I navigate the 7 layers effortlessly. There are some proprietary high-availability
protocols that I’m not fully into; but I’ve seen a lot.</p>
<p>I would also like to mention that I’ve been lucky enough to meet your CTO, John Graham-
Cumming, at the London office for an event some years ago—he’s an inspiring leader, and not
only technically; he would probably appreciate this resume and cover letter being produced in
<span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> :-) – his blog post from July 2019 on the Cloudflare outage is stellar; not only for its
technical in-depth explanations, but also from a customer- and employee-confidence point of
view—having such a lighthouse example as a beacon to navigate by makes leading considerably
easier.</p>
<p>I’ve been a long-time admirer of the Cloudflare journey – I would be a great addition to your
team. I am therefore looking forward to hearing from you,</p>

	<h4>Summary</h4>
	<p>In a world that is changing rapidly, I help companies transition and stay ahead. Not only by clear
data-driven decisions, but also by leading and innovating. While the current use of AI is primarily as
automation-agumenter—I can help prepare and adapt for future gains.</p>
	<p>Being highly skilled and well-versed in a plethora of technologies through decades of experience in the
IT industry, and with a broad background across multiple sectors in both B2C and B2B, such as
telecom, finance, security, and shipping, is enabling me to dive into all relevant parts of an IT
business.</p>
	<p>I aim to have people collaborate to move the business further and ahead, doing so by challenging silos
and gathering data that all can agree on; having the deep technical knowledge as well as product and
customer flair is an immense catalyst for clear results through cross-departmental work efforts.</p>
